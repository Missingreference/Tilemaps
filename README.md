# Tilemaps For Unity

A Tilemap library for Unity. This implementation is meant for performant tile creation and retrieval. Also aiming for optimal idle tilemap performance rendering.

Be aware that this project requires Utility repo https://github.com/Missingreference/Unity-Tools. It includes many helper functions, GridArray, texture atlas and graphics creation tools(Direct Graphics). Enable 'SAFE_EXECUTION' preprocessor for debug/development build and disable it in release build for maximum performance.
